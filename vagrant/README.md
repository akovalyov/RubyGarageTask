# Getting started using Vagrant

## You will need:

  * Git 1.6+
  * NFS (MacOS works OOB, on Debian based linux distributions install **nfs-kernel-server** package)
  * [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com)


Now everything is getting prepared.  
In the meantime you can optionally add an entry to your `/etc/hosts` file like so:

    192.168.56.101 rubygarage.dev

## Access by web browser

If you have added the entry to `/etc/hosts` you should be able to access the Sylius like this:

<http://rubygarage.dev>

Otherwise you can also use the IP address:

<http://192.168.56.101>
